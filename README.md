## Angular 2 Workshop - AngularConnect London 2015
### Presented by Joel Hooks ([@jhooks](https://twitter.com/jhooks)) of egghead.io

## Objectives

* Learn core Angular 2 principles and practices
* Build a "real" app (I mean, it's a Todo app, but close enough, eh?)
* Understand how Angular 2 relates to Angular 1 and translate the concepts

## What we won't do...

We won't go too far down the rabbit hole. We want to dig into Components and the concepts behind Angular 2. We aren't going to look at routing, or dig too deeply into Observables or some of the other new concepts in Angular 2.

"But I love rabbit holes!"

Totally. They are fun, but we've only got so much time in the day!
